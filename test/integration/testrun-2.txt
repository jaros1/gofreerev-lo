problem is in create_online_users_message
now only checking for server users match for login user
must check for server users matches for login user and friends
but cannot send online users message without sha256 signatures for logged in users

sha256 signatures for Jan Mobilos Roslind didn't match in previuous compare users run
sha256 signatures for Jan Mobilos Roslind match after new login and friend list update from login provider

there should have been send a user sha256 signature changed message when updating user and friends information
no "send sha256 message" in testrun-2 logs
sha256 signatures updated:
 console 1: Tue, 07 Apr 2015 16:13:41 UTC +00:00
 console 2: Sun, 05 Apr 2015 16:25:06 UTC +00:00

solution: added server.last_changed_user_sha256_at timestamp and send changed users in compare users message
