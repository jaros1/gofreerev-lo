 2) api notifications:
    get a app access token.
    send only notifications to api if internal notifications in app is not read.
    Short summary of unread app notifications in api notification
    Only few api notifications and stop sending messages if user do not start app
    for example notification every 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28 day
    one notification every day if user connects to app.
    don't send any more notifications if user has not been connected for 28 days
    check out facebook, linkedin & twitter notification possibilities
    https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/notifications/
    https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/user/notifications/
    get application token:

                   "ref"=>"notif", "notif_t"=>"app_notification"}
    - added FB app notifications for friends find

 3) add accept conditions for new users?

 4) recalculate user balance at request or once every day

 5) user.recalculate_balance recalculates balance for all closed deals with user as giver or receiver.
    ok when few closed deals for a user, but can be a performance issue with many closed deals for a user.
    allow recalculating balance from a specific date or from a specific gift.id
    should only recalculate balance from last closed deal

 7) check texts in views/fb/create.html.erb and create_da_html.erb

 9) check todo's in source

11) find some way to combine or group "identical" notifications in inbox/index page

12) stress test. make a db with really many rows and test performance.
    There maybe are missing an index or two
    there maybe are some sql that should be rewritten
    performance issues are different in sqlite3 and in mysql
    move development db to mysql before test
    db_load fails with import errors
    https://github.com/ludicast/yaml_db
    https://github.com/ludicast/yaml_db/pull/45
    second try - make an new mysql database for stress test

13) check session variables
    session variables should only be used from accessor methods in app. controller
    gives a better overview and an easier to maintain code

14) tests - needs new users.yml file - encryption now is with old userids

15) test case:
    create deal [ a.provider1, a.provider2] as giver, [ b.provider1, b.provider2 ] as receiver, price > 0
    login as a.provider1 and b.provider2
    problem with user/show balance. logged users are giver and receiver at the same time
    must be displayed as 0 in balance
    check code with [ag.user_id_giver, ag.user_id_receiver].index(user_id)
    check code with login_user_ids.index(ag.user_id_giver)
    check code with api_gift = api_gifts.find { |ag| [ ag.user_id_giver, ag.user_id_receiver].index(???)

17) add mysql development environment on localhost.
    there some are minor difference between using sqlite3 and mysql as db
    a) problem with "" around table names in mysql
    b) Less float precession in mysql than in sqlite3

19) check notifications and change notification test cases to support multiple logins

20) better github page

21) links on app setup pages to github page (wiki, report bugs etc)
    check app setup for facebook, google+, linkedin and twitter

22) post on linkedin from localhost
    can not upload picture with localhost url to linkedin
    add a special error message for this case?

24) add server site cleanup for api_gifts with temp url
    created in gifts/create - removed in util.delete_local_picture after post_on_<provider> tasks

25) check if user div onclick events could be handled on a higher level - for example on document
    can not use user_id in id. user divs are repeated many times for each user.
    use data-id attribute for user.id
    use jquery "on" and delegated events: https://api.jquery.com/on/

26) link from post on gofreerev to post on facebook but only if FB friend
    link from post on gofreerev to post on linkedin but only if LinkedIn connection
    should have small API icons for each post.
    multiple icons if multiple logins and post in multiple API's

27) check response from FastImage.type(gift_file.path) if site is temporary unavailable
    should not error mark pictures if a api picture server is temporary out of service
    FastImage.type returns nil if server is temporary unavailable
    Must combine FastImage = nil with a http get page notfound check
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2695020/how-can-i-use-ruby-to-check-if-a-domain-exists

29) deal proposal and changed friend relations
    cancel deal proposal when friends are removed
    could be remove friends in users/index page
    could be changed api friend relation in post login provider task

30) jquery. url from xhr object is used to find html element that triggered the ajax event
    for example to setup tables for ajax error messages within gifts/index page
    it could be nice if jquery has information about the html element that started the ajax request
    $(classname).bind('click', function ... - find id for html element with classname with triggered this bind handler
    jquery signatures. found a "success: function (responseText, statusText, xhr, $form)"
    signature for #new_gift ajax handler (ajaxForm). $form[0] was form object.
    jquery .bind("ajax:success", function (evt, data, status, xhr) signature
    dump properties for all 4 parameters. Maybe there is a back reference to element that triggered the event.
    dump of a beforeSend xhr object:
    tasks_form_xhr.status = undefined
    tasks_form_xhr.statusText = undefined
    tasks_form_xhr.readyState = undefined
    tasks_form_xhr[type] = ajax:beforeSend
    tasks_form_xhr[timeStamp] = 1395056109867
    tasks_form_xhr[jQuery1110005057767523957335] = true
    tasks_form_xhr[isTrigger] = 3
    tasks_form_xhr[namespace] =
    tasks_form_xhr[namespace_re] = null
    tasks_form_xhr[result] = undefined
    tasks_form_xhr[target] = [object HTMLFormElement]
    tasks_form_xhr[delegateTarget] = [object HTMLDocument]
    tasks_form_xhr[currentTarget] = [object HTMLFormElement]
    tasks_form_xhr[handleObj] = [object Object]
    tasks_form_xhr[data] = undefined
    tasks_form_xhr[isDefaultPrevented] = function returnFalse() { return false; }
    tasks_form_xhr[isPropagationStopped] = function returnFalse() { return false; }
    tasks_form_xhr[isImmediatePropagationStopped] = function returnFalse() { return false; }
    tasks_form_xhr[preventDefault] = function () { var e = this.originalEvent; this.isDefaultPrevented = returnTrue; if ( !e ) { return; } // If preventDefault exists, run it on the original event if ( e.preventDefault ) { e.preventDefault(); // Support: IE // Otherwise set the returnValue property of the original event to false } else { e.returnValue = false; } }
    tasks_form_xhr[stopPropagation] = function () { var e = this.originalEvent; this.isPropagationStopped = returnTrue; if ( !e ) { return; } // If stopPropagation exists, run it on the original event if ( e.stopPropagation ) { e.stopPropagation(); } // Support: IE // Set the cancelBubble property of the original event to true e.cancelBubble = true; }
    tasks_form_xhr[stopImmediatePropagation] = function () { this.isImmediatePropagationStopped = returnTrue; this.stopPropagation(); }
    xhr.target and xhr.currentTarget looks interesting

32) edit user options
    - cross provider balance y/n checkbox
    - share balance

33) a number of "invalid" inbox notification keys. Could be missing keys. Could be wrong notifications

38) add language LOV to page header if width > xxx

39) gift giver pic mouse over text should have information about multiple provider givers
    gift receiver pic mouse over text should have information about multiple provider receivers

40) google+ and twitter.
    how to prevent friend invitations from people you do not know?
    F - you are following someone on google+ and twitter, and do not want to receive friend invitations from them
    S - you are stalked by someone on google+ and twitter and do not want to receive friend invitations from them
    block all and allow selected users
    allow all and block selected users

43) User.api_gifts
    maybe problem with very big select if really many friends for logged in users
    on other option could be 2 sub queries combined with filter for deselected friends
    select * from api_gifts
    where user_id_giver in (select ...) and user_id_giver not in (1,2,3, ..)
    or    user_id_receiver in (select ...) and user_id_receiver not in (1,2,3, ..)

45) check out JS API's for login providers. most interesting are readonly API's (google+ and instagram)
    some not supported server site operations could be implemented with client side JS

46) users/index - friends of friends - why in list - show name(s) of friend
    maybe the same issue as in previous dropped mutual friends

47) find a better location for ajax tasks spinner in top of page
    show/hide spinner makes the page bouncing
    add mouse over title to ajax tasks title with explanation.
    maybe after ".create_gift_header_line"
    Maybe under ".description_prompt"

48) add mini spinners for some time consuming tasks.
    for example deleting a closed deal (recalculate balance)

49) users/index: search, friend name filter or alphabetical tabs
    it is slowly to scroll down (3 seconds delay for each 10 rows lookup)

50) running ajax tasks and http links - for example link to other page
    error. more information in server log" and ajax spinner is hidden
    should hide ajax error message and maybe not hide ajax spinner
    an other solution could be showing spinner after click on link

51) opera 12.16 bug when gofreerev starts from facebook https://apps.facebook.com/gofreerev-dev/
    Warning
    https://dev1.gofreerev.com/
    A page on the public internet requests data from your private intranet.
    For security reasons, automatic access is blocked, but you may choose to continue.
    Continue
    Always continue when data is requested from this server on my private intranet
    Generated by Opera.
    Only problem in first https://apps.facebook.com/gofreerev-dev/ request => get /
    Second https://apps.facebook.com/gofreerev-dev/ request => post /
    Opera console does not reveal any rejected localhost requests. But should not start with a "get /" in log

53) localhost / login servers Sandra/fb and Gofreerev A/gp
    2+2 notifications. 2 accepted and 2 accepted follow notification.
    for example 13. feb. 2014 11.58
    should only send notification to Sandra+Gofreerev as creator of proposal.
    should not send notification to Sandra+Gofreerev as follower of proposal.
    the same pattern for "outbox" for Jan R/google+ as sender of message.
    also 13. feb. 2014 11.58

55) how to check for an "official" gofreerev version
    easy to copy gofreerev and misuse the concept (harvest user information from API's)
    maybe a list of officiel gofreerev sites

56) users/index apiname=<provider> filter. Use login user = selected provider.
    in that way all user dev pictures are from the same login provider.

58) find all methods with case provider ... implementations. Should be listed in todo for adding a new login provider.
    maybe add a special search word that can be used to find all relevant points in source code when adding a new login provider
    add "API SETUP" comment for all case provider statements

59) users/index friends filter: add follows and followed by filters?

60) auth/index page
    - add * note for login providers that does not support post on wall
    - add missing provider? note. add a github page with request for missing login providers

 62) linkedin gem. frozen to an old version due to error. Unfreeze when error is solved
     https://github.com/hexgnu/linkedin/issues/216

 64) refactor linkedin & flickr controller translate keys into shared? Almost identical translations

 66) check out open graph meta-tags in flickr.
     maybe some that could by used
     <meta property="fb:app_id" content="137206539707334" />    x
     <meta property="og:title" content="u6bbc6h8oy" />
     <meta property="og:type" content="flickr_photos:photo" />
     <meta property="og:url" content="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gofreerev/12593199523/" />
     <meta property="og:site_name" content="Flickr" />
     <meta property="twitter:card" content="photo" />
     <meta property="twitter:site" content="@flickr" />
     <meta property="og:description" content="localhost/da/gifts/VyGiwGM7NXQ1JzBA2XAj1VV5zeGEtb" />
     <meta property="og:image" content="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3716/12593199523_7600c19134_z.jpg" />

     <meta property="twitter:description" content="localhost/da/gifts/VyGiwGM7NXQ1JzBA2XAj1VV5zeGEtb" />

 68) two or three column friend list in users/index page.
     responsive design or use javascript to organize table layout
     could use float divs in a multi column users/index page
     that is fixed width, height and fixed table column size
     number of users in http/ajax requests should match number of columns.
     2 columns: get 2 friends in first request - get 20 friends in next request
     3 columns: get 3 friends in first request - get 30 friends in next request
     problems with show-more-rows functionality?

 69) post on twitter: Exception: execution expired (Twitter::Error) after 6 seconds
     added exception to post on twitter for debug
     maybe a generic way to handle execution expired when posting on api walls
     repeat up to 3 times before giving up
     return warning to user and try once more time
     delete_local_picture task and expired post on wall exception!

 70) localhost - looking af gift id 909 logged in as Jan R/FB
     from user div ok = me
     to user div = dummy FB user gofreerev/facebook
     that is no information about google+ receiver 109316109373670614208/google_oauth2 Gofreerev A

     also a comments from 100006399422155/facebook Sandra Q
     can not se that comments also was from 109316109373670614208/google_oauth2 Gofreerev A
     Not necessarily a problem as users normally will use there real names, but can be a problem in test

 72) view: add timestamps to comments?

 74) add a JS text length counter when entering text. Twitter users would like to known how long the text is.
     special problem for twitter where 23 characters is subtracted from 140 for links and for images.
     one "<n> remaining characters" counter for each provider with post on wall selected and authorized?

 75) api_profile_picture_url with small (50x50) and big (100x100) pictures.
     100x100 (5246 bytes) is only used in users/index and users/show
     50x50   (1744/2877 bytes) is used everywhere else
     can make a difference on a slow connection / slow device

 77) distribute option:
     find friends / see gifts on other gofreerev servers
     user-a id api friend with user-b, user-a is on server-a and user-b on server-b.
     user-a should be allowed to see user-b's gifts on server b
     user-b should be allowed to see user-a's gifts on server a

 78) ruby profiler. It could be nice with a good ruby profiler statistic.
     http://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/27/quick-and-dirty-rails-performance-profiling/
     https://github.com/ruby-prof/ruby-prof
     http://david.paluy.org/blog/2013/04/09/profiling-rails-applications/

 79) collect and organize screen dumps

 84) css wrapword. word-break: break-all;.
     works fine on small width screens but do not look nice on wide screens.
     there is implemented a workaround for opera 12 (that does not support break-all).
     it could be nice to avoid break-all on wide screens but there would still be a problems with long texts without spaces
     a possibility could be hyphenator to insert soft hyphen into text: https://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/

 85) problem with ie10 new gift with very large text.
     submit bottom is moved under text area on wide pc screen

 86) auto-remove max height if text if only a bit higher than max height

 91) opera 12: A page on the public internet requests data from your private intranet.
     For security reasons, automatic access is blocked, but you may choose to continue.
     problem is not in opera 19 on windows.
     opera:config#Network|AllowCrossNetworkNavigation

 92) gifts link and comments links
     use jquery "on" and delegated events: https://api.jquery.com/on/
     "bind" works only for existing elements in page
     are using unbind+bind after adding new rows
     could not get it to work for comment-action-link ajax

 93) JS error handling. It would be nice with line number for JS errors.
     special a problem in old browsers (IE8)
     check http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1340872/how-to-get-javascript-caller-function-line-number-how-to-get-javascript-caller
     check https://github.com/stacktracejs/stacktrace.js

 94) make test check list. every test should be done in every supported browser.

 95) ie8 target=blank opens in a new window and no shared cookie.
     could be a special spoon.net test problem - could be a reel problem with IE
     ( test: use windows xp on virtualbox http://10.0.2.2 )


 96) check if there is any virtual machines available for test
     cannot test latest safari browsers from soon.net

 98) nice to have: decrease number of older comments in show older comments link if older comments has been deleted
     hard to implement without ajax replacing gift in gifts/index page

 99) there is a little problem with ajax replace new gift after new gift has been created
     problem is that user could be entering a new comment and that this new unsaved comment will be removed
     testcase: create new gift and start adding a comment for new gift - will be deleted in next new_messages_count request

100) fix scroll page scroll after new comment
     see scroll store and restore in JS post_ajax_add_new_comment_handler
     new comment should always be within actual view

101) entering new comment + click on menu link - no leave page yes/no dialog box
     entering new gift + click on menu link - no leave page yes/no dialog box
     maybe a generic solution - check solution for currency LOV

102) ie8 problem - new comment with very large text
     first click - resized to a smaller text area with scroll bars
     second click - submitted ok
     not a problem for new gift with very large text - what is the difference?
     ( test: use windows xp on virtualbox http://10.0.2.2 )

103) gofreerev.js - clear_ajax_errors(table_id) and clear_flash_and_ajax_errors
     clear all ajax error messages in web page
     add hidden timestamps to errors tables - ok
     add class for error tables - ajax_errors added
     add cleanup for old error messages
     timestamp column is not copied from tasks_errors2 to tasks_errors table (retest - maybe it was a client side JS message)
     timestamp column ok in show-more-rows-error table

104) fix sort when creating new comments in gifts/index page
     looks like character sort - must be number sort (gift id and comment id)
     fixed when creating new comments
     test ajax inject gifts and comments from other users into gifts/index page

105) reject_new_deal: reject link was removed - accept link was not removed

106) reject_new_deal: line with comment error message (proposal was rejected)
     is not removed when comment is ajax replaced with new comment from util.new_messages_count

108) controllers. add http/ajax comment to all relevant methods

109) controllers. check format_response in end of all ajax methods

110) ie8 - all tables must have a tbody and tbody must be used in ajax inject
     ( test: use windows xp on virtualbox http://10.0.2.2 )

112) check startup page size
     http://www.version2.dk/artikel/mobilsiderne-bliver-stoerre-og-langsommere-56847
     tools for faking a slow internet connection?
     http://www.ginktage.com/2013/11/tools-for-the-developers-to-simulate-slow-internet-connection/
     gifts/index - 20 kb
     users/index - 27 kb
     - long almost identical mail invite friends mailto texts.
     - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9014470/creating-email-link-with-dynamically-generated-body-with-html5-javascript

114) cross server friends invite / friends search?
     in a distributed server network different friends will use different servers and gofreerev apps

115) add hide link for text/url?
     "Gift was posted in here and on your facebook wall but picture cannot be displayed.
      Allow Gofreerev to read posts on my facebook wall!"
      one solution could be to set post on wall = N
      but it is only a problem for post with pictures

116) ie8 and ie9 - cross site forgery when starting gofreerev from apps.facebook.com/gofreerev-dev
     ( test: use windows xp on virtualbox http://10.0.2.2 - but 10.0.2.2 is not allowed in facebook app setup )

117) opera 12 errors:
     page header:
     Javascript fejl ved tjek for nye beskeder. NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'insertBefore' on 'Node': The node before which the new node is to be inserted is not a child of this node. (4,3).
     Javascript fejl ved indsættelse af nye kommentarer. NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'insertBefore' on 'Node': The node before which the new node is to be inserted is not a child of this node. (5,54).
     Fejl ved tjek for nye beskeder. error. Mere information i server log.
     added some more JS outputs to client side debug log

118) users/show balance tab.
     should show post for relevant user combination.
     but only if logged in for provider and friend with user
     should display ... rows for hidden posts. Not logged in as provider / not friend with user for this provider.
     should display "total row" if last post is hidden (not logged in as provider / not friend with user for this provider)

119) problem with show-more-rows pages and back bottom on browsers.
     last_row_id has been cleared. Error key shared.show_more_rows.last_row_id_invalid
     could force page reload when using back bottom in browser.

120) linkedin app invitation:
     https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/invitation-api
     but requires w_messages priv.

121) allow friends find without user_combination
     that will only work online and if other users have shared their accounts

122) check if there is some problems with friends cache for instagram:
     friend?: no friends cache was found for login user 1092213433/instagram gofreerev g

123) allow friends find without combined accounts and buffer search result for other user
     User A executes a friends find search with friends proposal B, C and D
     Buffer A as friends proposal for B, C and D (only if B, C and D is active app users)
     Include A in next friends find search for B, C and D
     Could use some extra column(s) in friends table as buffer
     There should also be a "not interested" or "read" link in friends find post
     Could use

124) first util.new_messages_count 1 minute after login (for friends find search)

125) better "friends find no rows" message.
     check last login date for shared accounts.
     user should login to refresh friends lists for other login providers

127) facebook grant write:
     "Your popup is too small to display this page. Please enlarge it to proceed.
     was displaying firebox console in bottom 1/3 of page
     must be a problem on all mobile devices!
     maybe it is only a problem in rest api - maybe JS api can be used
     maybe fake a bigger screen before calling facebook dialog
     check if there is a identical error messages on a smartphone

128) different share accounts title for:
     a) not logged in users
     b) single account logged in users
     c) multiple accounts logged in users

129) maybe a friends find version of app
     a) save access tokens for friend list refresh - maybe
     b) notifications for facebook and emails for the other api's

131) add share accounts options:
     0) not shared = blank
     1) share balance
     2) 1) + share friend lists
     3) 1) + 2) + save access token for offline friend list refresh
     4) 1) + 2) + 3) + single sign-on
     5) mixed sharing with 0), 1), 2), 3) and 4) user accounts
     change share accounts checkbox to a share accounts LOV

132) post_login_new_user: "Your friend list is ready. Please refresh page to see any posts from your friends."
     ok for single login users and gifts/index page.
     not ok for multi login users and auth/index page.

133) logged in with 7 shared accounts and 1 not shared account.
     should add not shared accounts to shared_accounts_list

134) auth/index: show/hide share accounts spinner while changing share accounts status

137) auth/index: share_level_lov and offline_access_checkbox are disabled after page refresh
     testcase firefox 30.0 : 1) change LOV or checkbox, 2) refresh page, 3) LOV is disabled
     tried a JS fix - save LOV disabled/readonly state at startup - restore LOV disabled/readonly state at reload - did not work

138) cannot change share_level from 3 to 4 if access token was read from database
     that is - only load access token from database if share level is 4

139) share level 3 and 4 login
     warning if one or more access tokens are about to expire
     for example within one week

141) add special single sign-on login message
     a) first single sign-on login with no expired access token
     b) first single sign-on login with one or more expired access tokens
     c) secondary single sign-on login - renew expired access token - no other expired access tokens
     d) secondary single sign-on login - renew expired access tokens - one or more expired access tokens
     e) likewise for share level 3 logins

142) could not get google+ login with online access to work (share level 0-2). offline access is always being used

145) ajax: missing "please wait" message when checking post on wall checkbox and active ajax task
     http: "please wait" (ajax_leave_page) is triggered by ajax event onbeforeunload and can not be used for checkboxes
     maybe not a big problem but current message for running task is cleared in page header when clicking on checkbox
     It could be nice if there is a to count number of running/pending ajax requests
     See window.onbeforeunload (gofreerev.js) and JS error message js.general.ajax_leave_page

148) auth/index. drop checkbox for offline_access_yn.
     many users will forget to check checkbox
     but is should be very clear that auth. information is saved on server for share level 3 and 4

156) user/edit delete account.
     ajax spinner ok at first delete account request (logical delete account)
     ajax spinner is mising at second delete account request (physical delete account)

157) check http://developer.sharethis.com/Web_Share_API
     "Sharing is Caring. Get access to web services that provide comprehensive sharing capabilities to 120 social destinations"

158) add better html title for gifts. Special important for shared gifts with deep link where html title maybe is used on API's

159) add app.net as login provider.
     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App.net
     https://github.com/phuu/omniauth-appnet
     https://developers.app.net/reference/resources/app-stream/lifecycle/

160) share gift lov
     add scrollbar to LOV (http://www.codeproject.com/Questions/229885/how-to-make-scroll-bars-in-dropdown-list)

163) Mixed Content warning in firefox 30.0 om dev1 server
     problem is img http requests to image farms at api providers
     https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/MixedContent
     could replace http with https if image farm supports https and has a valid ssl certificate

164) gifts/index create post.
     display field with providers where post on wall is selected and authorized so that user can see where gift is posted

167) util.get_api_picture_url_vkontakte
     better VK exception handling (now almost none)
     a) deleted picture
     b) authorization error
     c) other errors

168) util.get_api_picture_url_twitter
     better twitter exception handling
     a) deleted picture
     b) authorization error
     c) other errors

169) how to handle mouse over texts on touch screens

174) google refresh token and offline access
     check if there is an issue with disconnected google+ accounts and renewal of access token
     for logged in users google+ access token is renewed once every hour without problems
     maybe there is a timeout issue for disconnected google+ users
     add batch process to auth renewal of access token for disconnected google+ users with share level 3 and 4?
     see application_controller.fetch_users

175) auth/index share account lov performance problem
     many user updates

180) no exception mailer mail from ajax errors
     for example exception in post login

183) facebook is from oauth 2.0 a login only provider without friend list
     add other "no friend list" login providers
     can be used in single sign-on with providers with friend lists

184) client login - create public/private key pair when new user account is created
     encrypt private key with password
     save under 1_pub_key and 1_prv_key
     send public key to server before starting communication with other users

185) each user account must have a unique user id (global sequence)
     generated by server, added to rails session cookie and added to local storage 1_user_id

186) a created post belongs to a uid+provider user account - should be app independent
     allow post sync. between client user1 in app1 with client user2 in app2
     sync posts if user1 and user2 are friends in app1 and user1 and user2 also are friends in app2

187) opera 12.12 login with linkedin account fails with: Login from linkedin failed. Possible "Cross-site Request Forgery" problem.
     Started GET "/auth/linkedin/callback?oauth_token=77--4754aa8e-83d9-4513-8225-ada63fb09f9e&oauth_verifier=22848" for 192.168.0.13 at 2014-12-28 08:06:26 +0100

189) security problem with gift.description (inject html code into page).
     use angular $sanitize when creating gift
     and use $sanitize when fetching gift from other devices

190) move create new gift into "gifts" table as first tbody section after thead and before gifts ng-repeat loop
     offers/seeks radio group - move user div between first and second column
     goal: "identical" layout for create new gift and old gifts in gifts table

191) local authorization:
     - local storage login => userid => access to local storage arrays for login userid:
       1) authorization information for one or more login providers (maybe expired)
       2) array with users
       3) array with gifts
     - allow user 1 to be connected in tab 1 and user2 to be connected in tab2
     - rails. split session storage in userid/uid.
     - client must send userid in all client to server requests. 0 if not logged in.
     - server must include userid/uid in all page redirects
     - client should verify that correct userid/uid is received from server
     - device logout - send ajax request to server to remove authorization from session table (delete from sessions)
     - device login - send not expired access tokens to server for check and friends download
     - api logout - send ajax request to server to remove authorization for provider from session table
     - after local login 1 (ajax request)
       - check for expired api authorization
       - copy not expired api authorization to session cookie
       - get fresh user arrays (me and my friends)
     - after local login 2 (ajax request) - check for online friends on other devices - en friend can be online on more than one device
       - online friends on this gofreerev-lo app server (client to server communication)
       - online friends on other gofreerev-lo app servers (server to server communication)
       - server should select ping interval - client should ajust ping interval after server setting
     - after local login 3 (ajax requests) - compare gift lists with other login friends
       - get gifts from other online friends
       - send gifts to other online friends
     server must known online devices
     server must known authorization for each online device
     server must known friend lists (who is friend with who)
     server must receive list with giftids from each device?

192) picture upload allowed if logged in with one or more login provider
     pictures stored on gofreerev-lo server with long random path
     should delete all pictures uploaded by user when user account is closed
     should delete mark all gifts created by user when user account is closed
     should keep track of picture usages (var/log/apache/access.log) and removed old not used pictures
     max number of pictures uploaded for user/device?

193) trafic light should be red when returning from api provider
     shift to yellow while fetching friends information
     and shift to green after friends info has been downloaded

196) check kattekryptering - could be a way to share encrypted pictures
     http://www.version2.dk/artikel/cyberaktivists-chat-app-skal-holde-facebook-billeder-private-med-katte-kryptering-76685

198) client <=> client communication - design
     a messages can be send from one client on one server/app to an other client on an other server/app
     a client should remember that a request has been sent to an other client
     or server should only store last client to client message
     communicate only with online users or allow batch communication with offline users?
     push or pull changes to or from other clients?
     the server knows who is the friend with whom
     server should keep a gift list for each uid

200) testcase
     user 1 on uid 1 creates a gift a
     msg1 : user 1 sends local gift id + relevant userids to server 1 and receives a gift id from server 1
     user 2 on uid 2 receives message from server about gift a created by user 1 who is a friend
     user 2 sends an request to user 1 asking for gift a
     user 1 receives request from user 1 and sends an encrypted response to user 2
     user 2 receives encrypted response from user 1, decrypts and inserts gift in list on uid 2
     user 3 on uid 3 receives message from server about gift a created by user 1 who is a friend, location uid 1 or uid 2
     user 3 can request gift from user 1 / uid 1 or user 2 / uid 2

201) client <=> client communication - design 2
     client a creates gift with a local gift id and gets a server gift id from server
     server knowns friend lists and knowns witch uid/users that can can see witch gifts
     server keeps track of gift changes (create, new comment(s), accept, reject, delete)
     server returns after login a list with gift ids and last change timestamp to client a
     client a checks list and ask server for updates
     server waits for a online client b with gift and ask client b to sent gift to client a
     or server waits for a other online client c with gift and ask client c to send gift to client a
     client b (or client c) receives request and sent encrypted message to client a
     client a reads encrypted message and create/updates gift

208) x-server communication (x=cross)
     enable/disable x-server communication on user/did level (did = one or more users)
     disabled as default as most users only will use one gofreerev-lo app/server
     ask user to enable if user is using more than one gofreerev-lo app/server (user knowns if it is correct or not)
     x-server communication enabled - login on one server is also login on the other server(s)
     enable/disable x-server communication on gofreerev-lo server level - enable for one gofreerev-lo server / disable for other gofreerev-lo servers

210) design 3 - ping
     return list of online/active devices
     return devices with one or more shared login users or friend of login users
     if requested include a list of mutual friends for each device
     that gives user ids for gifts relevant for sync between devices
     device to device sync:
     - device a sends a list with a sha256 hash value for each gift to device b (login users and mutual friends)
     - device b receives gifts list from device a and returns a corresponding gifts list
     - device a and device b now have identified gifts relevant for sync between the two devices (create or update)
     - list could be sorted with newest update first in list and oldest update in last of list (start with newest)
     - sync must merge changes. liked by users a, b, c. unliked by users x, y, z
     - shared login user: gift liked by user x on device a + gift unliked by user x on device b (compare )
     - sync between devices can be done without gift meta-information on server

211) security issue - users can change data in localStorage
     how to prevent users from changing data in localStorage? (change hosts file and run js script updates from a fake host)
     could send a sha256 hash value to server in setItem and check sha256 hash value in getItem but this does not work for offline devices
     could cache sha256 hash values in js variable on offline devices but this does not work if user closes browser tab
     could do some security checks when sync gifts between devices
     giver_user_ids must be login user, friend or friend of friends
     receiver_user_ids must be login user, friend or friend of friends
     comment_user_ids must be login user, friend or friend of friends
     some attributes are readonly and can not be changed (userids, description, comment, created_at_client etc)
     user_id must be a valid gofreerev user - can not be user id for users that have never used gofreerev
     add a "make a fake" link to gifts and comments - users can make a gift or a comment post as fake if they don't trust post
     "marked as fake" can not be removed but owner can delete gift or comment
     could keep sha256 signatures for gifts and comments on server
     server create new gift/new comment - check authorization and save signature (gid => signature and cid => signature)
     client ask server if signature for a new gift or comment is valid
     sha256 signature with user ids and created_at_client timestamps - and maybe a short hash value for text (description/comment)?
     gid - one sha256 signature when created (created_at_client, direction, userids)
     gid - new sha256 signature when gift has been accepted by an other user (created_at_client and userids from giver and receiver)
     that can cause problems if gift is being replicated between two users with old sha256 key (before accept)
     and is there a security problem in changing sha256 signature?
     could add sha256 signature for accepted proposal (comment) to gift
     user lists: a) gift created by userids, b) proposal (comment) by userids, c) accepted by userids
     handle log out / page closed for offline devices and create comment / gifts
     - cannot verity new gift / new comment without correct login (userids)
     - should reject new gift / new comment with invalid login (login changed between create action and send to server action)

212) client ping loop
     increase ping loop if server does not response
     device could be offline and no need to use cpu for pings if device is offline (error response after 0 miliseconds)
     or server could be overloaded and no need to send request to an already overloaded server (error response after x seconds)

215) rejected gifts a:
     - change new gift error message "Invalid authorization. Expected 2 users. Found 4 users."
     - added better error messages in console log with provider name(s) for invalid og missing logins
     rejected gifts b:
     - remove rejected gifts from js array
     rejected gifts c:
     - an option could be a new gifts ng-repeat loop in top of gifts page with rejected gifts
     - allow user to resubmit rejected gifts with current authorization
     rejected gifts d:
      - give the user the option to choose between b or c

216) nice error messages if no internet connection (log in, log out, ping etc)

217) nice error messages if rails is not running (log in, log out, ping etc)

218) nice error messages after server timeout (log in, log out, ping etc)

222) remove oauth fields from users table

224) check how angularJS and tv4.js creates a JS stack dump. add better js exceptions with stack dump.
     https://github.com/stacktracejs/stacktrace.js

225) share gift - allow share gift - create new gift as copy and insert login user ids for current login

226) default protection for new gifts is private - show only gift to friends
     allow use to select public when creating a new gift.
     show public gifts that friends has liked or commented in stream

228) show selected console log error messages in inbox
     1) could not create gift signature on server
     2) device offline or no internet connection

229) "faster" cross server client to client communication
     use server to server communication to exchange dids and public keys
     push request to url on current server and check response from client in http gets on url on other server
     in that way users can communicate without server to server communication
     faster communication and lower server load

230) how to deauthorized an hacked api account or a unique device (did)
     access tokens are valid for 3 months and are stored in localStorage
     it would be a security problem forcing clients to sent access token to server for verification
     allow friends can ask for a verification for a potentially hacked account (new expires_at timestamp)
     allow friends to mark user, did or gift as spam. many spam mark => hacked account => dont replicate

231) activity log?
     - log in, log out, create gift, comment gift, new proposal, reject/accept proposal, replicate gift to/from xxx,
     - filters: add/remove events from log
     - inbox = log or seperate inbox and log?
     - filter notifications - what events to receive notifications for

234) routes.rb - new default root url (/main/auth)

235) design 4 - online devices
     ping returns a list with online devices
     check mutual friend in online devices response. should also be friends in users array
     new online device. initialise a full gifts sync for all mutual friends
     compare list with sha256 for each gift, send or request gift with sha256 difference, merge differences
     added mutual friend for existing online device. initialise a full gift sync for mutual friend userid

236) message buffer for device
     add an up-to-date of did for each userid
     change in a gift => buffer a message for did
     only send message in buffer if online and only for mutual friends
     keep buffering messages when a device is offline or a mutual friend is removed from did
     send messages next time device is online with did and mutual friends

237) big gift sync. used for new device or added mutual friend to an existing device
     send/request a full gift list for mutual friend
     localStorage limit:
     - only sync gifts with created_at/updated_at timestamp >= x
     - gifts with created_at/updated_at timestamp < x can be stored offline in encrypted data blocks on server
     - remove changed gifts from old data blocks and add to localStorage

238) localStorage space management
     add a oldest_gift_at timestamp to localStorage
     start with 1 year ago
     change timestamp if out of space and move older gifts to encrypted data storage on server
     sync only gifts with created_at / updated_at timestamp >= oldest_gift_at
     send oldest_gift_at timestamp in ping and return timestamp in list with online devices
     so that other devices know time interval to send sha256 hash for

239) add json schemas for client side gift and user objects
     maybe a js version and a stored version - a few fields are not saved in local storage

240) localStorage backup for development/test purpose
     could be nice to take a backup before running/testing client side data migration scripts
     http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17609198/how-to-backup-html-5-local-storage-data (see last post - code not complete)
     or send a complete json to server

241) menu: don't disable link in menu after click - page is no longer reloaded (share and login pages)

242) replicate gift signature to other server when replicating gift to client on other server
     gift signature on two servers should be 100% identical

243) server side sha256 gift signature and giver/receiver user ids
     now: using direction + user id list for a new gift. direction = giver or receiver
     that is a problem when gift is received/closed, direction is changed to both and user ids for other user is added to gift
     keep direction when deal is closed - will ensure unchanged sha256 server signature
     add cid to server side gift when gift is closed ( validate gift signature, validate comment signature, validate loin users, add cid )

244) replicate gift likes. replicate likes for all users or only for logged in users.
     1) replicate device a => b => c. device c can receive likes from device a and cannot verify likes from device a
     2) replicate only device a => b  and device a => c - that is between online friends
     1) gives fastest likes replication. 2) gives must secure likes replication

245) replicate gift follow between devices with identical logged in users
     follow could be a device only field
     follow could be a logged in user field
     follow on one device - unfollow on an other device - merge and compare timestamps - last timestamp wins
     multi-user login - follow with some login user ids - unfollow with other login user ids - follows wins

247) add server side sha256 signature for comments
     comment fields:
     - gid               -
     - user_ids          - comment created by user ids - must be logged in users - must be subset of gift providers
     - price             - new proposal price.
     - currency          - new proposal currency.
     - comment           - comment text
     - created_at_client - created at client unix timestamp
     - created_at_server - created at server unix timestamp
     - new_deal          - boolean: null or true. null: comment. true: new deal proposal
     - deleted_at        - deleted at client timestamp
     - accepted          - accepted boolean - true if accepted by creator of gift - false if rejected by creator of gift
     - updated_by        - user id list for users that have accepted or rejected proposal - must be a subset of creators of gift

250) routeprovider - don't redirect to gifts page for not logged in users

253) better client side data protection
     javascript: alert(Gofreerev.getItem('password')) and javascript: alert(JSON.stringify(sessionStorage))
     could check calling function (name or sha256 signature) and return null for invalid calls
     find a cross browser solution to find calling function
     js variables are always available for debugger
     encrypt password - moves the security problem to en other encryption key

254) buffer communication for offline devices on server
     send messages when device gets online
     but only if sha256 signature in pings is unchanged (unchanged login users)

255) add some kind of client message number to outbox.
     used be sender, server and receiver to reject doublet messages
     add sessionid to messages so that session reload (f5) can be detected
     old messages with old sessionid + new messages with new sessionid (delete old messages from server)

256) add other mailbox folders?
     outbox => sending => send
     inbox => processing => done

257) send buffered message on leave page (new api login)
     or buffer in localStorage - for example before login provider login (temporary leaving page doing omniauth login)

258) add updated_at_client timestamp to gift
     used when filtering out old gifts in gift sync between clients
     set when gift or comment are updated by client
     or set from other client in gift sync if gift has been updated by an other client

259) check js elapsed time for ping
     abort time consuming response processing before next ping starts
     for example merging a large number of gifts received from an other device
     also check elapsed time for pre ping request processing (should be fast)!
     place incoming messages in inbox folder until message is processed
     for example a large array with gifts where gift must be server side sha256 validated before gift is rejected or inserted into gifts array
     or alternatively abort next ping if response processing takes to long time
     maybe not a problem. javascript is single threaded in almost any usage
     but a browser should not use 100% pct for more than a few seconds

260) add json validation for client to client messages:
     password: todo:
     users_sha256: done
     gifts_sha256: done
     syn_gifts: done

261) add mutual_login_user_ids to pings? (identical login on two different devices)
     could be used to replicate a few gift properties between login users only
     for example follow and hide gift. change follow to an array with follow/unfollow timestamps
     hide and follow are not part of sha256 calculation and gifts with identical sha256 are not replicated!
     add two sha256 values to gift? or a special message to be used between devices with identical logins?

262) add api version in client to client messages.
     not a big issue in client to client communication within one gofreerev server (reload and js data migration scripts for data in localStorage)
     but could be a problem in cross server client to client communication
     one server with version 1.0 software communicating with a server with version 1.1 software
     server with version 1.1 must use protocol version 1.0 when communication with a version 1.0 server
     server with version 1.1 must use protocol version 1.1 when communication with a version 1.1 server
     for example an issue if new fields are added to gift or comment (new fields in messages and changed sha256 calc)
     server with version 1.0 should reject version 1.1 messages from other servers

263) add api version to json validation

265) add device.ignore_invalid_gifts check to all ingoing messages with gids

266) receipt for messages without a response
     1) fatal error in message - no next message in sequence
     2) ok receipt for final message in a sequence of messages
     3) return message with ignored gifts and error messages

269) add verify_comments request/response. new comments in send_gifts message must be server validated (old and new gifts)

270) find doublets early in send_gifts processing. the same gifts and comments can be send from several other devices in same ping response
     calculate sha256 when receiving gifts and avoid inserting copies of same gift/comment multiple times in msg.gifts, verify_gifts and verify_comments arrays
     insert only object once and insert reference to object the following times

271) split big messages in several smaller messages
     for example big send_gifts messages with many gifts
     a new user with many online friends will receive many very big messages after login
     it could also be server that buffers messages so that one client dont get spammed with many big messages (saves memory on clients)
     and maybe a client should not request the same gift and/or the same comments from many different online friends

272) maybe a minor problem in gift sha256 signature
     maybe giver and receiver user ids can be swapped without client sha256 signature or server sha256 signature changes
     but direction can not be changed and client should send correct user ids to server for server side sha256 validation

273) cross server gift and comment signature check (verify_gifts and verify_clients)
     server could return response for own gifts and comments to client and place messages for other gofreerev servers in a message queue
     send request message to other server(s) in next server to server ping and receive response message from other gofreerev server(s)
     return response to client in next ping when verification request is ready for remote gifts and comments
     how to identify that a gift or a comment is from an other gofreerev server?
     the client should allow delay in gift and comment verification for remote gift and comments
     seq in verify_gifts and verify_clients request should be a client sequence and not start from 1 in every new request
     that will allow server to respond immediately for some requests and later for other requests.

274) add server id to gifts and comments.
     there is immediate response for within server ping request/response
     there is delayed response for cross server ping request/response
     an example is verify gifts request/response
     server can verify own gift sha256 server signature immediately
     server must place verification for gift on other gofreerev servers in a message queue and response later
     client should know whether server response is immediate or delayed

275) add a remote (integer) field to gifts and comments if gifts or comments is from an other web server
     servers should agree about this integer

276) add version number to client to client messages. For example send_gifts_1 for send_gifts version 1?
     the receiving client should respond with a compatible message
     after  password handshake two remote clients should tell each others witch message versions to use in communication

277) some old gifts have been created with uppercase currency
     all new gifts should be created with lowercase currency
     add currency validation to angular view (regular expression)
     add validation to create new gift and create new proposal

279) delete gifts request
     maybe return deleted_at_server as an integer?
     a gift could have been created on one gofreerev server and have been deleted on an other gofreerev server!
     created_at_server / deleted_at_server could always be 1 for current server
     a server # <> 1 marks a gift as remote created or remote deleted and signature check must be done on an other server
     there must be a server # translation table on every gofreerev server
     server # can be 2 on one server, 3 on an other and 4 on a third server
     js: add gift.deleted_at_server (integer=server number)

281) add a server side last_validated_at / last_verified_at date stamp for deleted gifts only
     server can physical delete delete marked gifts that have not been server validated for n months
     that same applies for comments

282) add a servers table. server # 1 = actual server. table with url and server #
     server # for a url can be different on different gofreerev servers
     server # must be an url or there must be a server # translation table when communicating with other gofreerev servers
     server # must be included in some request/response operations (online, messages)

283) user ids. problem with using internal user ids in encrypted client to client messages
     server cannot change user ids in messages (gift giver, gift receiver and comment creator)
     must use either full user id (uid/provider) or sender or receiver must translate user ids
     there can be problems with internal user ids if user is unknown on one of the servers
     for example a comment from a friend of a friend that is unknown on actual server
     best to user uid/provider format in all client to client communication
     ok to user internal user ids in client/server communication.

284) refactor js gifts requests
     buffering requests for remote gifts should also be identical
     response for request with remote gifts can take some time and maybe come in a later response

285) use crypt_keeper for sha256 signatures? for example sha256, sha256_accepted and sha256_deleted in gifts
     maybe overkill - sha256 should be secure and crypt_keeper only protects database, not rails

286) json schema - add title and description to json schema definitions

287) new gift - check that giver user ids and receiver user ids are unique

288) new comment - check that comment user ids are unique

289) server sha256_accepted. include a "/" between giver user ids and receiver user ids
     or place direction between givers and receivers in signature input

291) json schema validation
     add uniqueItems - true/false in v4 specification but could be extended to support a string, an array
     for example validate unique gid in an array with gifts

292) add a loop counter in users_sha256 and gifts_sha256 message.
     ok with a few feedback loops until gifts are in sync but prevent endless loop if some update operations are rejected by one of the clients

293) add a validate gift function
     gift should be validated after all changes.
     Never save a invalid gift in localStorage. Never accept a invalid gift from an other client. Never send invalid gifts to other clients.
     compare old and changed gift when saving changed gifts in localStorage. Reject invalid updates.
     two validate functions:
     - invalid_gift(gift) - called when creating new gifts and before sending gifts to other clients
     - invalid_changed_gift(old_gift,new_gift) - called when updating gifts - local updates and gift updates received from other clients
     returns null (ok) or an error message

294) split big gifts item in many gift_1, gift_2, gift_3 etc items. from a sequence

295) add a big random key to be used between password and encrypted data in local storage
     key - random string - saved password encrypted in local storage
     other items - save key encrypted in local storage.

296) gifts page with no api provider login
     hide create new gift, disable create or redirect to auth page

297) add a borrow checkbox to gift - giver expects to have the gift returned at some point in the future
     add page where user can see what items that are borrowed from other users and what items that are borrowed to other users
     allow a borrowed item to continue to a third or a fourth user. a borrowed gift must have owner_user_ids

298) old messages in mailbox.sent that have not been moved to done
     GiftService.receive_message_users_sha256: Wait. Old gifts_sha256 message is already in sent." gofreerev.js:3867
     a) move old messages to error after x seconds or
     b) resend

299) invalid_gifts function - used when receiving gifts from other clients.
     error=Giver is invalid. Unknown user id 920 in giver_user_ids 920, 790
     from client A with a facebook+google login to B client with a google login
     user 920 (facebook) is known on A but unknown on B
     same issue if A and B er friends on google+ but not friends in facebook
     same issue on A client after disconnect from google+ (user 920 er unknown)
     user id could be server validated but not with the same method as for gifts and comments (user information can change)
     and how to handle cross server gift replication with an unknown user id? Known on server A. Unknown on server B.

300) change how users are stored in localStorage.
     users in localStorage is an full list of friends information downloaded after login
     that ok - preserves friend lists in omniauth login process where user temporary is redirected to an api provider
     preserve users used in stored gifts and comments after api provider log out?
     that will allow invalid_gifts to validate user ids for logged out providers
     with a validated_at_client timestamp for last server validation
     could include users array in sync_gifts/send_gifts sub message

301) delete gift after confirm:
     15:42:21.112 "Error: [$rootScope:inprog] $apply already in progress
     http://errors.angularjs.org/1.3.0/$rootScope/inprog?p0=%24apply

302) testcase: gift is deleted on client A and gift is accepted on client B
     both accept and delete actions are server validated and first man wins
     1) delete before accept.
        A: delete signature from client A created with blank accepted_cid and accepted_at_client in signature
        B: server should reject accept_gift transaction from client B as accept cannot come after delete
        B: client must unaccept accepted gift and show error message from server
        B: client B must wait for send_gifts transaction from A to B or send a request_gifts transaction to A
     2) accept before delete
        B: accept signature from client B
        A: server should reject delete_gift transaction from client A without an accepted signature
        A: client must undelete deleted gift and show error message from server
        A: client A must wait for send_gifts transaction from B to A or send a request_gifts transaction to B

303) send_gift message
     should never include:
     a) created_at_client gifts without created_at_server server number
     b) accepted_at_client gifts without accepted_at_server = true
     c) deleted_at_client gifts without deleted_at_server = true

304) two kind of gofreerev servers?
     1) gofreerev servers with api login methods and client to client communication - requires some setup
     2) gofreerev servers with communication only (login/logout is done on other gofreerev servers) - no setup - plugin and run
     find easiest way to implement 1) and 2)

305) maybe a problem with cpu usage in firefox. standby cpu usage should be low (not sending or receiving messages)

306) should use translations for notifications. English error message in log is ok but notifications should support language
     no problem with within site messages.
     there is an issue with cross site error message (msgtype=error)
     cannot use translation key+options in cross site communication
     server side undelete error :
     - can use key+options if client-server request
     - must use error if server-server request. gift.delete_gifts response must be translated before returning response to other server
     - key=error, text=server translated error message

307) add support for key+options in delete gifts response.
     use key+options for within site error message. use error for cross site error messages
     add delete_gifts wrapper for cross site delete gifts requests

308) allow other servers to use "ping" to send and receive message
     the cross server handshake could be implemented like client to client handshake

309) handle "remote delete".
     created by user A on server A, replicated to user A on server B. deleted by under A on server B.

310) each server should have a "public" catalog over "active" users. Last connect within x days.
     each server should search "public" catalogs for match and keep an ea

312) add server public/private keys
     add servers table: server_id, url, public key, private key
     this server: server_id = 1 and private key
     schema load - load a initial list of gofreerev servers from db/seeds.db
     server should at startup send handshake signal to a limited number of gofreerev servers
     1) send/request public key
     2) send/receive password for symmetric encrypted communication
     3) ping once every ... seconds.

313) register with password for old account
     error message or login on old account?

314) server to server communication.
     exchange lists with active users and find common active users or active friends of active users

315) server to server communication
     send message with new online users to relevant servers (common active users or active friends of active users)
     one mailbox for each server

316) server can be a server or a client for an other server
     server is master - server don't have to known url for calling clients
     server is client - server has to know url for other gofreerev servers

317) brainstorm. a server is a client.
     use httpclient on one server to create a login on an other server (util/login)
     A: send login_request (client_userid, client_timestamp, client_secret, did and pubkey) to other server B
     B: create session and returns response to client
     A: receives cookie with new session

318) login request should return interval for first/next ping

319) testcase:
     user A 1705481075/facebook Jan Roslind logged in on server A laptop.gofreerev.com

320) must server resources should go to real clients. not to server to server communication.
     limit number of server clients. minimum 2.
     limit number of server login on other gofreerev servers. minimum 2. select "best" servers to connect to.
     maybe rotate between possible gofreerev servers.
     few users - allow many server requests
     many users - allow few server requests

321) client pings are controlled with pings table and interval
     must keep track of timestamps for next allowed server ping

322) ping. reject ping request if ping request is too early

323) server to server compare user lists
     step 1: compare sha256(uid/provider+user_name) - return true for match
     step 2: send sha256(uid/provider+user_name)+secret to other server and get sha256(uid/provider+user_name+secret) returned.
             user match ok if returned sha256(uid/provider+user_name+secret) is correct

324) server to server - new unknown online device
     display token to client on this server and ask client on other server to enter token and vice versa
     the two users must use some other communication chanel to exchange tokens
     don't replicate gifts to/from other server before device has been human verified

325) keep track of calling servers (under current server).
     don't call a server that already is under current server.
     maybe keep track of all levels of calling servers.
     A calls B that calls C. C should know that A is calling B so that C does not call A and creates a "loop"
     messages from C to A should pass through B

326) change client server requests to messages?
     for example change new_gifts request => new_gifts message with server did as receiver and client did as sender
     server must check for incoming messages to server and send outgoing messages to client
     add server_id to messages and online
     allow one server to pass messages between other gofreerev servers
     A => B => C. B receives message from A and send message to C
     B can not read message as message is symmetric encrypted between A and C

327) add server register before first server login?
     send password to server and store sha256 password hash on server
     check password in login request
     maybe use client secret as password? (received in login request)
     register with client secret in clear text and login with sha256 secret check

328) calculate distance between 2 gofreerev servers.
     1 if direct connected (as child or as parent)
     2 if indirect connected via a child or a parent
     etc
     statistic for elapsed time when sending and receiving message to other gofreerev server
     select best elapsed time when forwarding a message to an other gofreerev server
     also count number of unsecure and more or less secure connections in path to other gofreerev server
     better to use a slow secure connection that a fast unsecure
     use longer symmetric password over unsecure connections

329) server to server messages must have a sender and a receiver did

330) client to client message:
                   :messages => {
                       :type => 'array',
                       :title => 'Request with messages from client',
                       :description => '',
                       :items => {
                           :type => 'object',
                           :properties => {
                               # receiver did - unique device id - js unix timestamp (10) with milliseconds (3) and random numbers (7) - total 20 decimals
                               :receiver_did => {:type => 'string', :pattern => uid_pattern},
                               # receiver sha256 signature for generated from client secret and login user ids. used in client to client communication
                               :receiver_sha256 => {:type => 'string'},
                               # public/private key encryption (rsa) or symmetric key encryption? start with rsa and continue with symmetric
                               :encryption => {:type => 'string', :pattern => '^(rsa|sym)$'},
                               # message for receiver device encrypted with device public key
                               :message => {:type => 'string'}
                           },
                           :required => %w(receiver_did receiver_sha256 encryption message),
                           :additionalProperties => false
                       },
                       :minItems => 1
                   }
     rsa encrypted or sym encrypted using client to client encryption keys
     no information about gofreerev server
     server could keep track of cross client communication and forward message to correct server
     but client should know that friend is on an other gofreerev server and client should accept or reject communication with friend
     could be in form of a verification token that one or both clients must enter before communication can start

331) "42 characters password to long for RSA"
     limit with about 128 characters in an RSA message with a 2048 bits key is not correct
     check if jsencrypt has problems with 2048 rsa key
     test with longer passwords in server symmetric password handshake

332) change rsa/sym encryption setup?
     drop symmetric password handshake between two clients
     send message with a "small" rsa encrypted key and a big symmetric encrypted message
     faster and maybe more secure than symmetric password handshake
     but both clients should be party in securing communication (sending client could have used an insecure key)

333) device login old laptop
     showing register dialog but accounts already exists

334) is CryptoJS being used or not
     assets/javascript/cryptojs folder on old laptop from backup disk with 7 js scripts (1-core.js, 2-md5.js, 3-evpkdf.js, 4-enc-base64.js, 5-cipher-core.js, 6-aes.js, 7-sha256.js)
     used in KJUR.asn1.ASN1Util function in jsencrypt.js but I don't think that this function is used
     new laptop is working OK without CryptoJS

335) rsa message - now only used for symmetric password setup
     use first byte as msgtype. '0' = password setup
     both js receive_messages and rails receive_messages

336) change password message from json array to comma separated string. Don't used comma in passwords

338) server must know if client to client messages must be forwarded to an other gofreerev server
     did in pings table if client did on this gofreerev server
     pings table must include information about online clients on other gofreerev servers
     ping.server_did? rename ping.did to ping.client_did?

339) must forward cross client to client messages to other Gofreerev Server
     best to wrap cross server client to client messages in a server to server message
     information about client and server did is in pings table on actual Gofreerev server
     information about client and server did should also be in pings table on receiving server
     but server to server message could be routed through one or more servers without this information
     and remote client can go offline before message is read

340) end server symmetric password setup with an ok response?
     continue to send rsa password message until ok response is received from other Gofreerev server

342) server to server messages
     add mid, request_mid and via_did to messages

343) return response to an message through same route as request?

347) auth/index on old laptop - confirm field is displayed with password field for a device logged in browser

349) 60 seconds ping interval after login
     ping interval in login should be calculated like ping interval in ping

350) change server to server password setup message from rsa to mix encryption?
     could add more meta information to password setup message (sender, receiver, mid, via_did)
     could allow forwarding a password setup message to an other Gofreerev server

351) keep received server to server message in memory.
     there is no reason to insert and delete incoming messages into/from messages table

352) changed user name
     add user to user verification buffer for all servers where user is unknown
     using api profile picture url for facebook
     general: add user to user verification buffer when change in sha256 input for a user
     insert user as not verified in server_users table

353) no match for identical fb account on gofreerev-lo (app 1) and gofreerev-lo2 (app 2)
     user_name identical, api_profile_picture_url identical, user_id NOT identical
     maybe use api_profile_picture_url when comparing fb accounts
     check other api providers:
     - facebook: different user_id for identical fb users. sha256 signature changed use api picture profile url instead of uid
     - flickr: todo: check
     - foursquare: todo: check
     - google+: todo: check
     - instagram: todo: check
     - linkedin: todo: check
     - twitter: todo: check
     - vkontakte: todo: check

355) users message
     1) startup - loop for all users
     2) check new users
     3) change users with changed sha256 value (change in user_name or for FB change in api profile picture url)
     see issue 352

356) more encryption in initial server to server login request?
     https should be used in all client<=>server and server<=>server communication
     cookie hijacking is always possible in an unencrypted http connection
     but no reason to make fake requests too easy

357) add optional decrypt filter before /util/login
     translate signature {:encryption => 'mix', key => xxx, :message => xxx}
     to decrypted message {:client_userid => 1,
                           :client_timestamp => (Time.now.to_f*1000).floor,
                           :client_secret => SystemParameter.secret,
                           :did => SystemParameter.did,
                           :pubkey => SystemParameter.public_key,
                           :site_url => SITE_URL}
     and continue normal login process
     can be used in http communication or for extra security in https communication
     public key must be known to use this trick
     response must also be encrypted if request was encrypted
     for example with identical signature {:encryption => 'mix', key => xxx, :message => xxx}

358) place a copy of public key in /public?

359) symmetric encrypt cookie?
     session cookie is only used by rails
     could keep client part of symmetric password in client and send password rsa encrypted to rails in every request
     server part of symmetric password on server
     session can be stolen but session data cannot be read
     almost all data is in localStorage or in sessions table on server

360) code review / security review

361) move pseudo user ids buffer (in memory array in client and server_user_requests db table on server) to messages.
     this will allow messages to be forwarded through other gofreerev servers and messages to be returned "out of other"
     use mid (unique message id) in all messages and include request_mid in response
     add folder field to messages table (outbox => sent => error or done)

362) server to server communication
     encrypt big ping message instead of each message in messages array?
     ok to encrypt messages that is to be forwarded to other Gofreerev servers

363) allow server to return a compare users message without an incoming compare users message
     allow server to return a online users message without an incoming online users message

364) server pings. must be external user id.
     2.0.0-p598 :004 > pings[0]
      => #<Ping id: 224, session_id: "9c653cde5b1cd771756cf2dc49a1376d", client_userid: 1, client_sid: "14270197126896206557", last_ping_at: #<BigDecimal:7c73e70,'0.1427055769 598E10',27(27)>, next_ping_at: #<BigDecimal:7c73df8,'0.1427055771 598E10',27(27)>, did: "14252356907464191530", user_ids: "---\n- 1705481075/facebook\n", sha256: "0SumAAlBe/4vEMdftHU5puueYlccj0F50zDaUGkV4/Y=\n", server_id: nil>
     2.0.0-p598 :005 > pings[1]
      => #<Ping id: 225, session_id: "2", client_userid: 1, client_sid: "2", last_ping_at: #<BigDecimal:7c73c90,'0.1427055767 296E10',27(27)>, next_ping_at: #<BigDecimal:7c73c18,'0.1458678170 387E10',27(27)>, did: "14259151245218705856", user_ids: "---\n- 1126\n", sha256: "RFknrRnG4TL+zhBkoTc2dgNkdFoIRMLxrOYduv3CKvQ=\n", server_id: 1>

365) ok send a login request to an secure https gofreerev server
     not allowed for a secure https server to send a login request to an insecure http server
     a secure https gofreerev server could invite insecure http server to login as a client

366) add optional server_id to pubkeys table
     used in client to client communication across gofreerev servers

367) client to client communication step 2 - :users_sha256 message
     problem with internal user ids in cross gofreerev server messages
     internal user id is ok in within server client to client communication
     uid/provider cannot be used in cross gofreerev server communication (facebook)
     must use user.sha256 signature in cross gofreerev server communication

368) are rails Base64.encode64(Digest::SHA256.digest(x)) signature identical
     with JS CryptoJS.SHA256(x).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64) signature?
     compare rails and JS SHA256 calc for all users
